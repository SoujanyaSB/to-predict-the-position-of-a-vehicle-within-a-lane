This code demonstrates the general structure for developing an algorithm to predict the position of a vehicle within a lane using computer vision techniques. It involves preprocessing the input image, detecting the lane boundaries, and predicting the vehicle position based on the processed lane image.

Please note that this code assumes you have a video file named 'lane_video.mp4' in the same directory as the code file. You may need to adapt the code to your specific requirements, such as integrating it with a camera feed or adjusting the lane detection and vehicle position prediction algorithms based on your needs.
